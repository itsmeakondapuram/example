            I'm a Sys Admin with extensive experience in scripting and automation. Currently, I'm working as a Senior DevOps Cloud Engineer, focusing on automating infrastructure provisioning in the cloud. I have proficiency in infrastructure configuration languages like Puppet and Chef, allowing me to write automation scripts that streamline various tasks in the software development lifecycle.
            <br><br>
            My role involves deploying and managing applications and services using container technologies like Docker. I also contribute to automating and supporting CI/CD pipelines for different applications, utilizing my knowledge of CI tools like Jenkins and build automation tools like Maven and Gradle. Additionally, I have expertise in version control systems like Git, ensuring efficient collaboration and code management.
            <br><br>
            One of the main aspects of DevOps, in my opinion, is the combination of a company culture and a set of tools aimed at automating software releases. By embracing modern technologies like cloud computing and leveraging infrastructure languages, such as Puppet and Chef, I strive to automate and optimize tasks throughout the release process.
            <br><br>
            In terms of specific tools, I'm familiar with the Windows Azure Portal. It serves as a web-based interface accessed through a web browser, where I can log in with my Windows Live ID. From there, I can create hosting accounts to run applications, storage accounts for data storage, or both, depending on the requirements of the project.
            <br><br>
            Overall, my expertise lies in utilizing DevOps principles, modern technologies, and automation to enhance software development processes, ensuring efficient and reliable software releases.

            As I'm a Senior DevOps Cloud Engineer, my day-to-day responsibilities revolve around customizing and managing private sharing centers on AWS, dealing with up to 1000 instances. I work extensively with various AWS services, such as EC2, Route 53, CloudFormation, RedShift, CloudFront, CloudWatch, IAM, and DynamoDB.
            <br><br>
            In one of my projects, I designed and implemented AWS solutions to ensure business continuity. This involved setting up a virtual data center in the AWS cloud to support an Enterprise Data Warehouse. Additionally, I deployed numerous applications, utilizing almost the entire AWS Stack, including EC2, Route 53, CloudFormation, RedShift, CloudFront, CloudWatch, IAM, and DynamoDB with NoSQL.
            <br><br>
            I'm well-versed in automating processes, often using Python scripts in CloudFormation templates to configure auto scaling and elastic load balancing. My expertise also extends to Docker container services and Kubernetes orchestration. I have experience with implementing Master-minion architecture, creating multiple Kubernetes clusters, and managing pods. I regularly write YAML files for creating pods, replication controllers, services, deployments, labels, health checks, and use ingress for load balancing. In terms of Kubernetes management, I prefer working through the command-line interface rather than the web UI.
            <br><br>
            For automation and continuous integration, I design Jenkins build pipelines and architect Jenkins Clusters for High Availability. I've integrated Jenkins with various tools like Jira, JUnit, Mockito, SoapUI, Cucumber, Sonar, and HP Fortify to enhance testing and code quality.
            <br><br>
            Another significant aspect of my role involves using Chef for Infrastructure as Code and configuration management. I've written numerous Cookbooks and Recipes, covering tasks from simple file and directory creation to complex deployments and automation. My proficiency includes working with Chef features like Roles, Environments, Data bags, Vault encryption, and seamless Chef Client and Server integration.
            <br><br>
            To ensure server monitoring, I have implemented Nagios and Splunk solutions for critical servers. I also integrated Splunk with AWS deployment using Puppet, enabling data collection from database server systems into Splunk.
            <br><br>
            Overall, my role encompasses a wide range of tasks, including cloud customization, automation, containerization, CI/CD, configuration management, and monitoring. My goal is to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the systems I manage within the AWS environment.
